need a better king graphic and animation.
the animation bars are thicker in the original.
and the shape of the king ship is different.
maybe the animated bars are brighter?

--

maybe model the phosporous of the vector monitors?
lines should glow, and there should be a ghost of a ship as it moved.

---

sometimes there is an initial window drawing problem.

--
need better sound effects that are more like the original.

--
there are reports of this game crashing often on trisquel.
